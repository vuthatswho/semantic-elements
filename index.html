  <h1>What are Semantics?</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Semantics are descriptive and precise ways for coders to define their
  items on a webpage. It is better to use descriptive semantics than divs and spans. This is
  crucial for people who are looking at your HTML code (interoperation). It also helps for
  internationalization, accessibility, and searchability. Personally, I see a lot of divs
  and spans in the workplace and it frustrates me. Telling the developers to use clear semantics
  will help me do my job easier by knowing what to search for when grabbing page elements.</strong>
